## Disclaimer

    Why I used native base?
    I dind't have much time to develop this project, so I choose the native base to follow a design-system base, this help me a lot to be faster on my development, I know that native base could be expensive sometimes in terms of project because of your size and your declartive form, but in this case suit me well
